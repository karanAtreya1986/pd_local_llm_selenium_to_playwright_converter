# Findings & Research

## Initial Hypothesis
- We need to parse Java code (likely using an AST parser like `javaparser` or similar, or regex if simple).
- We need to map Selenium concepts to Playwright concepts.

## Constraints
- Handling Wait strategies (Implicit/Explicit -> Auto-waiting/await).
- Handling Page Object Models.
